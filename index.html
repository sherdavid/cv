    <p><em>Broadcast IT Engineer</em></p>
    <p>I have been an engineer for more than 10 years covering satellite broadcasting and studio production. Recently our job has been integrated with a lot of IT stuff and now I am called a Broadcast IT Engineer. To enhance my skills I am now learning web site development and I find it really fun. It is very similar to Engineering where there is a lot of building things or in this case building websites. I 💚 <strong>coffee and <strong>playing ♔chess</strong></strong></p>
